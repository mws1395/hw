## ***DeFi Carbon Offsetting Fron DOVU***

### Overview & Origin: *What is DOVU?*
    In short, DOVU offers crypto users a way of capturing carbon and supporting rural communities. 
    
    Founded in 2016 by CEO Irfon Watkins(a), a serial entrepreneur with his most successful venture prior to DOVU being a wev advertising company named Coull, and  COO Krasina Mileva(b), an attorney with over 13 years experience in the tech industry, DOVU was intended to be  "A transport focused protocol to accelerate the development of mobilitiy related decentralised applications, using the DOV Token as a reward mechnaism to power new business models in the transportation sector"(c). And initially, they were met with succcess; they earned funding from InMotion Ventures - the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover - and Creative England - a government-backed fund in the UK, successfully held an Initial Coin Offering raising 20000 ETH in 2017 (USD Equivalent of $6M).
    
    However, like many other fledgling projects, they struggled to gain the 
    appropriate footing necessary in the wickedly volatile crypto currency market 
    and fell to $0.001 by the end of 2018 after an Initial Coin Offering price of 
    $0.15 and an all time high in $1.03 during the 2017/2018 crypto market bull 
    run(d). And during the two and a half year span their native coin was trading 
    at fractions of a penny, they kept at their work until they noticed a 
    potentially huge demand that they had the capabilities to fill - offsetting 
    the carbon footprint. They realized that there was no effective carbon 
    offsetting solutions in the market and that there was also tons of landowners 
    all over the globe with carbon stores and no way to monetize from them. As 
    such, they pivoted and released a whitepaper focusing on DOV V2(e).

### Business Activities: *How is DOVU going to achieve this?*
    As stated on their whitepaper(e), DOVU's goal is to "implement a two-sided 
    marketplace for montezing carbon assets backed by an elastic supply token 
    target to the price of carbon". The belief is that in doing so, they will be 
    able to help their partners offset the carbon footprint created by their 
    crypto endeavors while incentivizing landowners with carbon-store rich 
    properties to maintain them. With this strategy, DOVU plans to address the 
    highly debated topic on the emissions created by cryptocurrencies.

    The intended customers for this project are any entities looking to decrease 
    their carbon footprint. Per the Digiconimist's the mining of Bitcoin alone is 
    on pace to generate 58.69 megatons of CO2 - the same amount as the entire 
    country of Lybia. Furthermore, a single transaction generates the same amount 
    of energy as 1.56M Visa transactions (f). Add these numbers to the increased 
    pressure created by the likes of Elon Musk (g) and the entrance of large 
    institutions like Tesla, PayPal, and Square entering the space of crypto and  
    it's very clear to see that there is a clear demand for a solution to 
    Bitcoin's emissions issue. 

    The way they plan to exchange these assets is by a mechanism called "Proof of 
    Carbon". The plan is to release tokens called cDOV - which represent a unit 
    of value with a single-use to offset real-word carbon. These tokens are 
    gradually adjusted or "rebased" on a daily basis using a range of oracles, or stores of live data, on the Ocean Protocol to feed up-to-date data regrading 
    the price of carbon. When a land owner holding land rich with carbon stores 
    would like to monetize them, they will use the ownership and location 
    information to create a smart contract containing the terms for payments in cDOV. From here, they may offer these assets in a tokenized pool of potential 
    carbon storage to buyers looking to offset their footprint. Buyers would then 
    exchange their DOV tokens for cDOV and purchase their desired offsets 
    accordingly. 
    
    Once purchased, the projects will release the cDOV to the holder based on the 
    terms of the smart contract. Upon completion of the project's carbon in-take, 
    the holder will receive an NFT for the asset representing the amount of 
    carbon offset and the cDOV tokens will be "burnt" or removed from circulation.
