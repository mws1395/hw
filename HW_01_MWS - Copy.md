## ***DeFi Carbon Offsetting Fron DOVU*** 
---
### Overview & Origin: *What is DOVU?*
    In short, DOVU offers crypto users a way of capturing carbon and supporting rural communities. 
    
    Founded in 2016 by CEO Irfon Watkins(a), a serial entrepreneur with his most 
    successful venture prior to DOVU being a wev advertising company named Coull, 
    and  COO Krasina Mileva(b), an attorney with over 13 years experience in the tech industry, 
    DOVU was intended to be  "A transport focused protocol to accelerate the development of mobilitiy 
    related decentralised applications, using the DOV Token as a reward mechnaism to power new business 
    models in the transportation sector"(c). And initially, they were met  with succcess; they earned 
    funding from InMotion Ventures - the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover - and Creative England 
    - a government-backed fund in the UK, successfully held an Initial Coin Offering raising 20000 ETH 
    in 2017 (USD Equivalent of $6M).
    
    However, like many other fledgling projects, they struggled to gain the 
    appropriate footing necessary in the wickedly volatile crypto currency market 
    and fell to $0.001 by the end of 2018 after an Initial Coin Offering price of 
    $0.15 and an all time high in $1.03 during the 2017/2018 crypto market bull 
    run(d). And during the two and a half year span their native coin was trading 
    at fractions of a penny, they kept at their work until they noticed a 
    potentially huge demand that they had the capabilities to fill - offsetting 
    the carbon footprint. They realized that there was no effective carbon 
    offsetting solutions in the market and that there was also tons of landowners 
    all over the globe with carbon stores and no way to monetize from them. As 
    such, they pivoted and released a whitepaper focusing on DOV V2(e).

### Business Activities: *How is DOVU going to achieve this?*
    As stated on their whitepaper(e), DOVU's goal is to "implement a two-sided 
    marketplace for montezing carbon assets backed by an elastic supply token 
    target to the price of carbon". The belief is that in doing so, they will be 
    able to help their partners offset the carbon footprint created by their 
    crypto endeavors while incentivizing landowners with carbon-store rich 
    properties to maintain them. With this strategy, DOVU plans to address the 
    highly debated topic on the emissions created by cryptocurrencies.

    The intended customers for this project are any entities looking to decrease 
    their carbon footprint. Per the Digiconimist's the mining of Bitcoin alone is 
    on pace to generate 58.69 megatons of CO2 - the same amount as the entire 
    country of Lybia. Furthermore, a single transaction generates the same amount 
    of energy as 1.56M Visa transactions (f). Add these numbers to the increased 
    pressure created by the likes of Elon Musk (g) and the entrance of large 
    institutions like Tesla, PayPal, and Square entering the space of crypto and  
    it's very clear to see that there is a clear demand for a solution to 
    Bitcoin's emissions issue. 

    The way they plan to exchange these assets is by a mechanism called "Proof of 
    Carbon". The plan is to release tokens called cDOV - which represent a unit 
    of value with a single-use to offset real-word carbon. These tokens are 
    gradually adjusted or "rebased" on a daily basis using a range of oracles, or 
    stores of live data, on the Ocean Protocol, to feed up-to-date data regrading 
    the price of carbon. When a land owner holding land rich with carbon stores 
    would like to monetize them, they will use the ownership and location 
    information to create a smart contract containing the terms for payments in cDOV. 
    From here, they may offer these assets in a tokenized pool of potential 
    carbon storage to buyers looking to offset their footprint. Buyers would then 
    exchange their DOV tokens for cDOV and purchase their desired offsets 
    accordingly. (e)
    
    Once purchased, the projects will release the cDOV to the holder based on the 
    terms of the smart contract. Upon completion of the project's carbon in-take, 
    the holder will receive an NFT for the asset representing the amount of 
    carbon offset and the cDOV tokens will be "burnt" or removed from circulation. (e)

#### Landscape: *Is the market ready for DOVU?*
    As a company operating in the digital asset space, other start-ups with similar goals, 
    DOVU is subject to the threats of incredible market volatility, 
    and potential government restriction.
    
    DOVU's main competitor in the industry is climatetrade - a company that utilizes an
    API to allow consumers to offset their carbon footprint by providing the exact carbon
    footprint & cost generated by the product or service and then offering a selection of
    projects available to compensate it with. Upon purchase, the user receives a nominative
    certificate with all the information about the project. The main difference is that they
    accept PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard rather than a native coin.(h)
    
    The biggest challenge DOVU may face, however, can be a result of the same problem they
    set out to solve; with the increased attention to the insane emissions created by crypto-
    currencies, we have seen countries like Iran ban the mining of bitcoin(i), India propose
    legislation to ban cryptocurrency all together(j), and China baning financial institutions
    from Bitcoin transactions(k). Combining regulations like this continue to pop-up in the industry
    with the volatility involved in the cryptocurrency space, many start-up projects like DOVU 
    can be de-railed before they take off - much like they were back in 2018.

### Results: *Has DOVU done anything yet?*
    Currently, DOVU is still in it's very early stages. As evidenced in the roadmap below, most
    of what DOVU has set out to do is still. According to their website, they have offically
    announced partnerships with Hedera to utilize the Hedera Hasgraph to log their transactions(l),
    Ocean Protocol as a market place for farmers to publish their carbon data(m), and Poly Network
    to allow for cross-platform coin transactions to purchase DOVU(n). In addition to those partnerships,
    they have announced that two other companies - Raini, an NFT platform(o), and  Shyft Netowrk,
    a proof-of-authority blockchain(p) - have agreed to partner with DOVU in hopes of making their
    companies completely carbon neutral.

    For the time being, however, the success of DOVU can be told by the performance of their DOV
    token in the market place. Currently, DOVU is ranked as the 889th largest cryptocurrency by market
    cap per coinmarketcap.com(q) with a market cap of $13.4M. There are currently 5,447 holders. 
    The top 10 holders currently own 72.3% of the total circulation. Such a centralization of the tokens
    is in-line with the early stages where which the project lies as it shows they're hoping to control
    price action while the market is incredibly volatile.
    
    In comparison to a competitor like Climatetrade, they appear to be slightly behind in partnerships as 
    Climatetrade has announced strategic partnerships like Iberia Airlines and Santander Bank. 
    Additionally, their current platform is much more easily accessible for anyone looking to offset 
    their carbon footprint. However, as DOVU operates directly in the digital asset space and accepts 
    cryptocurrency, have a stronger infrastructure in place to capitalize on the growth of cryptocurrnecies.
    
### Recommendations: *What should DOVU do differently?*
    
    DOVU has an incredible use case. They have founders with proven histories in the digital asset space. And
    they have industry leading technology now at their disposal. What else can they be doing?
    
    While DOVU is clearly in its early stages, I do not believe it is too early to invest in increasing
    brand awareness. With the narrative for a demand in the market they're looking to serve being at an
    all time high, I believe DOVU would stand to benefit greatly from a strong marketing campaign. One solution
    I would recommend would be onboarding farmers looking to monetize assets and starting a catalog for the
    carbon off-setting resources that will be available like Climatetrade has done. In a time where so many 
    coins with nearly meaningless use cases are gaining value by the promotion of influencers on social media,
    DOVU promoting the beneficiaries of their project can be seen as a tasteful and refreshing change in the 
    crypto market. By doing this, they may be able to begin to attract the names of larger companies looking
    to invest in the carbon offset market.
    
    To reach potential farmers, DOVU should utilzie the marketing APIs on social media platforms like Facebook, 
    Instagram,and Twitter. While many farmers may not be versed in the crypto space, directly presenting them with 
    information on how they may monetize carbon-offsets may encourage them to begin researching the possibility.
    These marketing tools allow companies to filter out who they want to see their advertisements based on what their
    public interests are set out to be. This would allow for an organic growth that a company in it's early stages would
    really benefit from. In not rushing to increase the prices by hiring influencers to market the coin, they would
    be relying on potential partners to market the actual product instead.
