## ***DeFi Carbon Offsetting Fron DOVU***

### Overview & Origin: *What is DOVU?*
    In short, DOVU offers crypto users a way of capturing carbon and supporting rural communities. 
    
    Founded in 2016 by CEO Irfon Watkins(a), a serial entrepreneur with his most successful venture prior to DOVU being a wev advertising company named Coull, and  COO Krasina Mileva(b), an attorney with over 13 years experience in the tech industry, DOVU was intended to be  "A transport focused protocol to accelerate the development of mobilitiy related decentralised applications, using the DOV Token as a reward mechnaism to power new business models in the transportation sector"(c). And initially, they were met with succcess; they earned funding from InMotion Ventures - the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover - and Creative England - a government-backed fund in the UK, successfully held an Initial Coin Offering raising 20000 ETH in 2017 (USD Equivalent of $6M).
    
    However, like many other fledgling projects, they struggled to gain the appropriate footing necessary in the wickedly volatile crypto currency market and fell to $0.001 by the end of 2018 after an Initial Coin Offering price of $0.15 and an all time high in $1.03 during the 2017/2018 crypto market bull run(d). And during the two and a half year span their native coin was trading at fractions of a penny, they kept at their work until they noticed a potentially huge demand that they had the capabilities to fill - offsetting the carbon footprint. They realized that there was no effective carbon offsetting solutions in the market and that there was also tons of landowners all over the globe with carbon stores and no way to monetize from them. As such, they pivoted and released a whitepaper focusing on DOV V2(e).

### Business Activities: *How is DOVU going to achieve this?*
    As stated on their whitepaper, DOVU's goal is to "implement a two-sided marketplace for montezing carbon assets backed by an elastic supply token target to the price of carbon". The belief is that in doing so, they will be able to help their partners offset the carbon footprint created by their crypto endeavors while incentivizing landowners with carbon-store rich properties to maintain them. With this strategy, DOVU plans to address the highly debated topic on the emissions created by cryptocurrencies.

    The intended customers for this project are any entities looking to decrease their carbon footprint. Per the Digiconimist's the mining of Bitcoin alone is on pace to generate 58.69 megatons of CO2 - the same amount as the entire country of Lybia. Furthermore, a single transaction generates the same amount of energy as 1.56M Visa transactions (f). Add these numbers to the increased pressure created by the likes of Elon Musk (g) and the entrance of large institutions like Tesla, PayPal, and Square entering the space of crypto and  it's very clear to see that there is a clear demand for a solution to Bitcoin's emissions issue.
